# About Me

👋 Hi, I’m the creator of Cuboost. I work alone to create simple things that can help us in our everyday life. I put all my creations on my [website](https://cuboost-website.web.app/).

## Languages

I mainly do Web 🕸️ development: I use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. However, I’m currently learning App 📱 and Game 🎮 development.

Cuboost/Cuboost is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
